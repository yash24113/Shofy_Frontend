# Wishlist Functionality Fix - User Switching Support

## Problem Statement
The wishlist functionality was not properly handling user switching scenarios, particularly when users switch between different Google accounts or log in from different systems. The wishlist data was not being properly associated with specific userIds, causing data to persist across different user sessions.

## Solution Overview
Implemented a comprehensive userId-based wishlist management system that:

1. **Tracks userId in Redux state** - Added userId to auth slice
2. **Centralized user selectors** - Created consistent userId access across components
3. **Automatic user switching detection** - Detects when users switch accounts
4. **Cross-tab synchronization** - Handles user switching across browser tabs
5. **Persistent storage** - Maintains userId in localStorage for session persistence

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Auth Slice (`src/redux/features/auth/authSlice.js`)
- Added `userId` to initial state
- Updated `userLoggedIn` action to store userId
- Added `setUserId` and `clearUserId` actions
- Enhanced `userLoggedOut` to clear localStorage

### 2. Centralized User Selectors (`src/utils/userSelectors.js`)
- Created `selectUserId` - Gets userId from Redux with localStorage fallback
- Created `selectUser` - Gets user object from Redux
- Created `selectIsAuthenticated` - Checks authentication status
- Created `selectUserInfo` - Gets comprehensive user information

### 3. Enhanced Wishlist Slice (`src/redux/features/wishlist-slice.js`)
- Added `currentUserId` tracking to know which user's wishlist is loaded
- Added `clear_wishlist_for_user_switch` action
- Updated fetch actions to track userId in meta

### 4. Custom Wishlist Manager Hook (`src/hooks/useWishlistManager.js`)
- Detects userId changes and clears previous user's data
- Handles window focus/visibility changes
- Manages cross-tab synchronization via storage events
- Provides consistent wishlist state management

### 5. Updated Components
- **Wrapper** (`src/layout/wrapper.jsx`) - Uses wishlist manager hook
- **WishlistArea** (`src/components/cart-wishlist/wishlist-area.jsx`) - Simplified with hook
- **WishlistItem** (`src/components/cart-wishlist/wishlist-item.jsx`) - Uses centralized selectors
- **ProductItem** (`src/components/products/fashion/product-item.jsx`) - Uses centralized selectors

### 6. Enhanced Auth Check Hook (`src/hooks/use-auth-check.js`)
- Improved userId initialization from localStorage
- Better handling of user data persistence

## How It Works

### User Login Flow
1. User logs in → userId stored in Redux and localStorage
2. Wishlist manager detects userId change
3. Fetches wishlist data for the new userId
4. Updates UI with user-specific wishlist

### User Switching Flow
1. User switches Google account → new userId detected
2. Previous user's wishlist data cleared from Redux
3. New user's wishlist data fetched
4. UI updates to show new user's wishlist

### Cross-Tab Synchronization
1. User switches account in another tab
2. localStorage 'userId' changes
3. Storage event triggers in other tabs
4. Other tabs automatically refresh wishlist data

### Session Persistence
1. User closes browser and reopens
2. Auth check hook reads userId from localStorage
3. Wishlist manager fetches data for persisted userId
4. User sees their wishlist without re-login

## Benefits

1. **User-Specific Data**: Each user sees only their own wishlist
2. **Seamless Switching**: No data leakage between different user accounts
3. **Cross-Device Sync**: Wishlist data persists across devices for same user
4. **Automatic Updates**: No manual refresh needed when switching accounts
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network issues and edge cases

## Testing Scenarios

The implementation handles these scenarios:

1. ✅ **First-time login** - Wishlist loads for new user
2. ✅ **Google account switching** - Previous data cleared, new data loaded
3. ✅ **Logout/login cycle** - Data properly cleared and restored
4. ✅ **Cross-tab switching** - All tabs sync automatically
5. ✅ **Session persistence** - Data survives browser restart
6. ✅ **Network interruptions** - Graceful error handling

## Usage

The system works automatically once implemented. No additional configuration needed.

### For Developers
- Use `selectUserId()` from `@/utils/userSelectors` to get current userId
- Use `useWishlistManager()` hook in components that need wishlist data
- The system automatically handles user switching and data synchronization

### For Users
- Login with any Google account
- Add items to wishlist
- Switch to different Google account → see different wishlist
- Switch back to original account → see original wishlist
- Data persists across browser sessions and devices

## Files Modified

1. `src/redux/features/auth/authSlice.js` - Enhanced with userId tracking
2. `src/hooks/use-auth-check.js` - Improved userId initialization
3. `src/utils/userSelectors.js` - New centralized selectors
4. `src/redux/features/wishlist-slice.js` - Enhanced with user tracking
5. `src/hooks/useWishlistManager.js` - New custom hook
6. `src/layout/wrapper.jsx` - Updated to use new hook
7. `src/components/cart-wishlist/wishlist-area.jsx` - Simplified with hook
8. `src/components/cart-wishlist/wishlist-item.jsx` - Updated selectors
9. `src/components/products/fashion/product-item.jsx` - Updated selectors

## Future Enhancements

1. **Offline Support** - Cache wishlist data for offline access
2. **Real-time Sync** - WebSocket-based real-time updates
3. **Bulk Operations** - Add/remove multiple items at once
4. **Wishlist Sharing** - Share wishlists between users
5. **Analytics** - Track wishlist usage patterns

## Conclusion

The wishlist functionality now properly handles user switching scenarios, ensuring that each user sees only their own wishlist data regardless of how they switch between Google accounts or systems. The implementation is robust, scalable, and provides a seamless user experience.
